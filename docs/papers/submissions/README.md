# ACBP — Abstracts & Submission Pack
Prepared: 2025-08-18 (Asia/Riyadh)

This folder contains three tailored abstracts and utilities to submit ACBP as:
- AMIA (Operations / Applied Informatics) — short paper or poster
- IEEE ICHI — research track poster/demo
- CIDR-style systems poster/demo (data systems audience)

Artifacts to cite:
- Repo: https://github.com/DotKBoy-web/acbp
- Site: https://dotkboy-web.github.io/acbp/
- Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.16891510, 10.5281/zenodo.16891549
- Systems paper: /docs/papers/acbp-systems-paper.pdf

Numbers (from `dashboard_app.py` + seeds):
- Clinic: P50 ≈ 818 ms, P95 ≈ 937 ms (n=1,680)
- Inpatient: P50 ≈ 614 ms, P95 ≈ 750 ms (n=1,680)
- Daily SLO: clinic ≥95% under 920 ms; inpatient ~83–91% under 700 ms (Wilson 95% lower bound)

Assumptions to confirm:
- Word limits (often 250–300 for posters)
- Whether the venue is blinded (most posters: not double-blind; CIDR: single-blind/light)
- Whether a video is required (we’re targeting poster/demo = **no video**)
