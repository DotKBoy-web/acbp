## AMIA (Ops/Applied) — Cover Letter
Dear Program Committee,

Please consider our abstract “ACBP: A SQL-Native Categorical-Boolean Paradigm for Deterministic, Sub-Second Clinical Dashboards” for the Operations/Applied Informatics track (poster or short paper). The submission demonstrates a formal equation compiled to SQL with in-database verification and live latency SLOs (P50/P95, Wilson bounds). No video requested; we can present a live demo or poster.

Conflicts of interest: none. Human subjects: synthetic data only. Artifacts: repository + Zenodo DOIs included.

Sincerely,
Muteb Hail S. Al Anazi (DotK)

## IEEE ICHI — Cover Letter
Dear Chairs,

Enclosed is “The ACBP Equation: Compiling Categorical-Boolean Clinical Policies to Verifiable SQL with Sub-Second Dashboards” for a poster/demo. The work emphasizes determinism, governance, and reproducibility. We include code, SQL verifiers, and a small UI with SLO tracking. No protected health information; all data are synthetic.

Best regards,
Muteb Hail S. Al Anazi (DotK)

## CIDR-style Systems Poster/Demo — Cover Note
Dear CIDR Organizers,

We propose a poster/demo titled “From Equation to MatView: ACBP Compiles Categorical-Boolean Policies into Verifiable Decision Spaces with Sub-Second Joins.” We will show the compilation pipeline, SQL theorem checks, and live latency distributions. The artifact is lightweight and reproducible on PostgreSQL + Streamlit.

Thank you,
Muteb Hail S. Al Anazi (DotK)
