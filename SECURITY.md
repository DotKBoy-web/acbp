# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email **dotkboy@outlook.com** (or **dotkboy@outlook.com**)
with details and a minimal PoC if possible. We’ll acknowledge within **5 business days**
and aim to provide a triage decision within **10 business days**.

## Scope

- Code in this repository and released artifacts.
- Not in scope: third-party dependencies, Docker images we don’t publish.

## Safe Harbor (good-faith research)

We won’t pursue legal action for **good-faith** vulnerability research that:
- respects our **Noncommercial** license,
- avoids data exfiltration and privacy violations,
- does not degrade or disrupt other users,
- and gives us a reasonable remediation window (default **90 days**) before public disclosure.

We don’t run a bounty program at this time; we may acknowledge reporters publicly
upon request after a fix is released. `dotkboy@outlook.com`
